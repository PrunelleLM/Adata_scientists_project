## Intoduction to the problem
In 2007, the #MeToo has been treding on the social media, especially after the Weistein gate in 2017. Ever since, the debate around inequalities between men and women has been a burning subject. Organized sexual exploitation of young women, like the gate of Jeffrey Epstein, inequalities, trivialized sexism, sexual harrasement, consent, all have been on the headline of the journals and debated over and over in the social media. 

According to a research pursue by the UNWomen over more than 100 countries, the sexism in the media nowadays is striking. In terms of managing position, men still represent 73 % of the top media management position, accoring to another study gatering 522 news media organizations. Moreover, about 46% of news stories spread gender stereotypes and only 6% promote gender equality.  Finally according to this same study, less than one third of all speaking characters in film are female.

These last decades, discrimination against women has been the burning subject. Raping scandals like the Weinstein gate in 2017, questions about the salary differences lifted by famous Hollywoodien actress Jennifer Lawrence in 2016, the debate about the disappearance of women that are more than 40 in the movies, and the #MeToo scandal paved the way for changes in our society about women status. In 2019, in Switzerland, the first feminist strike in 40 years took place. They asked for salary equality, the right to be a mother and to work at the same time, they denounced marital violence (according to amnesty international, in Switzerland, a woman dies under the blows of their companion every two weeks) and want a new definition of rape that will protect the women more. Moreover, last year, sexism is brought to light on the EPFL campus by the #PayeTonEPFL group where thousands of people, and in majority women, testify about a time where they felt discriminated against. The number of testimony about sexual harassment, raping, and discrimination was appalling. 
 
Can we see the impact of these scandals in the media? Are men and women equally represented in the media? Are they covering the same subjects?  
And are they equally distributed among the entire political specter? Does the political orientation of the media have an impact on how women are quoted?
 
## Number of times women are quoted in the data

Twenty years ago, 189 UN Member States recognized the central role of media in shifting the gender stereotypes that influence how we think and act. They made women and media one of 12 critical areas of the Beijing Platform for Action, and called on media everywhere to make a far greater contribution to women’s advancement.
 According to a simple analysis of the data, we can see very clearly that even though feminist events have occurred, the difference in terms of repartition of the representation hasn't significally change. Indeed, in our timelapse, the repartition of occurences of speak between women and man stays on a base of 20% agains 80%.

We obtained the same values as a study realize in .... by thr women ONU.

But is this difference linked with a difference of number of quoted men and women or the number of time they are quoted?
We found that men represent 80% of the quoted person whereas the women represent only 20%.

![Percentage_global_peok.png](https://github.com/PrunelleLM/Adata_scientists_project/blob/gh-pages/Percentage_global_peok.png)

Moreover, when we plot the data of the number of quotations per person, the outlier are in majority men, and event without the outliers, the difference in terms of number of quotation per individual is striking.

We can then conclude that event though many feminist events have occured the last five years, we don't see the effect of these events now. Indeed, over a period of five years, the women are in a state of withdrawal comparing to men. They are less present on the public scene, and when they are, th meida coverage is smaller. 
But maybe it will happen with a delay?
