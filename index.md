## Introduction to the problem
Ever since 2007, _#MeToo_ has been trending on social media, especially after the Weinstein gate in 2017. Since then, the debate around inequalities between men and women has been a burning subject. Organized sexual exploitation of young women, like the gate of Jeffrey Epstein, inequalities, trivialized sexism, sexual harassment, consent, all have been on the headline of the journals and debated over and over in social media.

According to research pursued by the UNWomen over more than 100 countries, sexism in the media nowadays is striking. In terms of managing positions, men still represent 73 % of the top media management position, according to another study gathering 522 news media organizations. Moreover, about 46% of news stories spread gender stereotypes and only 6% promote gender equality. Finally, according to this same study, less than one-third of all speaking characters in films are female.

These last decades, discrimination against women has been the burning subject. Raping scandals like the Weinstein gate in 2017, questions about the salary differences lifted by famous Hollywoodien actress Jennifer Lawrence in 2016, the debate about the disappearance of women that are more than 40 in the movies, and the #MeToo scandal paved the way for changes in our society about women status. In 2019, in Switzerland, the first feminist strike in 40 years took place. They asked for salary equality, the right to be a mother and to work at the same time, they denounced marital violence (according to amnesty international, in Switzerland, a woman dies under the blows of their companion every two weeks) and want a new definition of rape that will protect the women more. Moreover, last year, sexism is brought to light on the EPFL campus by the #PayeTonEPFL group where thousands of people, and in majority women, testify about a time where they felt discriminated against. The number of testimony about sexual harassment, raping, and discrimination was appalling.

Can we see the impact of these scandals in the media? Are men and women equally represented in the media? Are they covering the same subjects?
And are they equally distributed among the entire political specter? Does the political orientation of the media have an impact on how women are quoted?

 
## Number of times women are quoted in the data

According to a simple analysis of the data, we can see very clearly that even though feminist events have occurred, the difference in terms of repartition of the representation hasn't significantly changed. Indeed, in our timelapse, the repartition of occurrences of speak between women and man stays on a base of 20% against 80%.

We obtained the same values as the study realized by the women ONU.

But is this difference linked with a difference in the number of quoted men and women or the number of times they are quoted? We found that men represent 80% of the quoted person whereas women represent only 20%.

Moreover, when we plot the data of the number of quotations per person, the outliers are in majority men, and event without the outliers, the difference in terms of the number of quotations per individual is striking.

We can then conclude that even though many feminist events have occurred in the last five years, we don't see the effect of these events now. 
Indeed, over five years, the women are in a state of withdrawal compared to men. They are less present on the public scene, and when they are, the media coverage is smaller. But maybe it will happen with a delay?
