## What is the context?
These last decades, discrimination against women has been the burning subject. Raping scandals like the Weinstein gate in 2017, questions about the salary differences lifted by famous Hollywoodien actress Jennifer Lawrence in 2016, the debate about the disappearance of women that are more than 40 in the movies, and the #MeToo scandal paved the way for changes in our society about women status. In 2019, in Switzerland, the first feminist strike in 40 years took place. They asked for salary equality, the right to be a mother and to work at the same time, they denounced marital violence (according to amnesty international, in Switzerland, a woman dies under the blows of their companion every two weeks) and want a new definition of rape that will protect the women more. Moreover, last year, sexism is brought to light on the EPFL campus by the #PayeTonEPFL group where thousands of people, and in majority women, testify about a time where they felt discriminated against. The number of testimony about sexual harassment, raping, and discrimination was appalling. 
 
Can we see the impact of these scandals in the media? Are men and women equally represented in the media? Are they covering the same subjects?  
And are they equally distributed among the entire political specter? Does the political orientation of the media have an impact on how women are quoted?
